4. Then set up Appium Directory. Menu >> Windows >> Katalon Studio Preferences >> Katalon >> Mobile. Here, set the Appium Directory folder. Additionally, by default, itâ€™s usually installed at C:\Users\\{your login account}\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\appium.
5. Test APK is located in the project directory, which is called Apk.

* Here I use android studio AVD (Android Virtual Devices) manager for Virtual Device. I didn't connect any android phone to my desktop. If you run a low-end pc, you need to plug in your android phone to your desktop.

1. It would help if you were a developer mood. (Example: Press MIUI Version rapidly)
2. Go to the Developer Options. Enable USB Debugging, USB Debugging (Security Settings), Install via USB.
3. Connect your phone via USB to your device.
